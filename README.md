### Hi, I'm Abdul Bari 👋

I'm Data Scientist with interests in **Healthcare AI**, **NLP**, and **Applied Machine Learning**.

My work connects research methods with real-world applications — from clinical early-warning systems to classification and sentiment analysis projects. I'm particularly interested in using data and AI to improve healthcare outcomes and support digital health ecosystems.

### 🔬 Current Work
- Building an **Early Warning AI System** to predict short-term clinical deterioration using synthetic EHR data (Synthea)
- Experimenting with classical ML models (LogReg, RF, XGBoost) and sequence models (LSTM) for healthcare outcome prediction

### 📚 Research & NLP Projects
- **Bug Classification Using Machine Learning** — MSc Dissertation  
Applied ML to automate software bug classification with models such as Neural Networks, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression.  
Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, showing ML outperforming traditional detection methods.  
Proposed a pipeline for integrating ML-based bug triaging into software development workflows, improving efficiency and prioritization in QA processes.

- **Sentiment Analysis: Amazon Prime vs Netflix Tweets**  
Performed comparative sentiment analysis using NLP techniques, preprocessing, word clouds, and polarity scoring.  
Used Tableau for visual storytelling and insight interpretation.  
Findings indicated strong engagement (>10k tweets/day) with Amazon Prime showing more positive sentiment and lower subjectivity vs Netflix.

- **Text Clustering Experiments** — Unsupervised learning + TF-IDF/Word2Vec embeddings

### 📊 Applied Analytics & Dashboards
- **NHS Waiting Time Analysis** — Operational performance & visualization
- **GenAI Adoption in Finance** — Domain research + dashboard storytelling
